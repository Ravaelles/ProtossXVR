======================

   This is AI for StarCraft: Brood War. It has been created in Java, using JNIBWAPI in version 0.3.7, using BWAPI 4.0.1.

   Currently Bot is beating default CPU AI without much troubles. I've been working on it for I guess more than month of continuous work.

   To run it follow instructions at: http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial
It is entire Eclipse project, which should be easy to run. To inject this code you'll need ChaosLauncher, you'll find all instructions necessary in the tutorial above. Once you follow provided (and very good) readme file it shoudln't be hard. But you must have at leats minimal experience with Eclipse.


What AI does. Well, basically all it can to win :-) 
So basically:
   + Focuses on land units, but produces some Arbiters and Corsairs
   + Establishes new bases
   + Strategy is defensive, but mixed with decisive pushes into new enemy bases
   + Depends highly on efficiency of Dark Templar harassment
   + Tries to avoid deaths of wounded units
   + Uses some simple spells like Hallucination
   + Countless small behaviors like avoiding to build in the middle of choke point
