======================

This is AI for StarCraft: Brood War. It has been created in Java, using JNIBWAPI in version 0.3.7, using BWAPI 3.7.4 (or 4.0.1, I'm not sure lol).

To run it follow instructions at: http://sscaitournament.com/index.php?action=tutorial

It is entire Eclipse project, which should be easy to run. To inject this code you'll need ChaosLauncher, you'll find all instructions necessary in the tutorial above.


What AI does. Well, basically all it can to win :-) 
It's too much to describe, but basically:
   + Focuses on land units, but produces some Arbiters and Corsairs
   + Establishes new bases
   + Strategy is defensive, but mixed with decisive pushes into new enemy bases
   + Depends highly on efficiency of Dark Templar harassment
   + Tries to avoid deaths of wounded units
   + Uses some simple spells like Hallucination
